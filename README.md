# Google Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share User Behaviors Analysis

This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. The goal is to analyze the user behaviors of Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, and provide recommendations to increase the number of annual members.

## Data Source

The analysis is based on the Cyclistic bike trip data for the last 12 months in 2022, provided by Motivate International Inc. The data is structured in CSV format and contains key information such as trip duration, start and end stations, bike type, and user type (casual or member).

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involves the following steps:

- Remove any rows with missing or invalid values
- Standardize the column names and data types
- Add new columns for trip date, day of week, month, and hour
- Filter out any outliers or extreme values

## Data Analysis

The data analysis process involves the following steps:

- Calculate summary statistics for trip duration, distance, and speed by user type
- Visualize the distribution of trip duration, distance, and speed by user type
- Compare the usage patterns of casual and member users by trip date, day of week, month, and hour
- Identify the most popular stations, routes, and bike types by user type
- Perform hypothesis testing to compare the mean trip duration of casual and member users

## Data Visualization

The data visualization process involves the following steps:

- Create a dashboard using Google Data Studio to display the key findings and insights
- Use charts, maps, and tables to visualize the data and highlight the differences between casual and member users
- Add filters, slicers, and interactive features to allow users to explore the data
- Add titles, labels, legends, and annotations to explain the data and provide context

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The conclusion and recommendations are based on the following key insights:

- Casual users tend to have longer, farther, and slower trips than member users
- Casual users are more likely to use the service on weekends, holidays, and summer months than member users
- Casual users are more likely to start and end their trips at popular tourist attractions and recreational areas than member users
- Casual users are more likely to use docked bikes than member users, who prefer electric bikes
- There is a significant difference in the mean trip duration of casual and member users, with casual users having longer trips on average

Based on these insights, the following recommendations are suggested to increase the number of annual members:

- Launch a marketing campaign that targets casual users who use the service frequently or for long durations, and offer them incentives to join the membership program
- Provide more information and education on the benefits and features of the membership program, such as unlimited rides, lower fees, and access to electric bikes
- Improve the availability and accessibility of electric bikes and docking stations, especially in areas where casual users are more likely to start and end their trips
- Create more bike routes and trails that connect popular tourist attractions and recreational areas, and promote them to casual users who are looking for fun and leisure activities
- Offer discounts or rewards for referrals, reviews, or feedback from casual users who have a positive experience with the service
